Alt accounts are typically used for various purposes such as testing, trolling, or bypassing bans. Players often create alt accounts to have a separate identity in the game or to engage in activities without affecting their main account's reputation or progress.","An account type that comes with the mail that was used to create the account, usually used for people who wants to keep the account.","An account type that is no longer obtainable through the official Minecraft website.

It is available for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms. Java Edition is favored by many players for its extensive modding support, larger multiplayer servers, and frequent updates. Players can enjoy a wide range of customizations and community-created content.","Bedrock Edition","Minecraft Bedrock Edition, often referred to as just \"Minecraft,\" is the cross-platform version of the game available on various devices, including Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, mobile devices, and more. It features cross-play support, allowing players on different platforms to play together. Bedrock Edition offers a consistent experience and frequent updates across all supported platforms.","Modded Minecraft","Modded Minecraft refers to any version of Minecraft (usually Java Edition) that has been modified with player-created modifications or \"mods.\" These mods can add new gameplay features, change existing mechanics, introduce new content, or enhance graphics. Modded Minecraft offers endless possibilities for customization and allows players to create unique and personalized experiences.","Cracked Minecraft","Cracked Minecraft is an unofficial version of the game where players can use pirated copies to play without purchasing the official game license. This practice is illegal and discouraged by both Mojang (the developer of Minecraft) and the Minecraft community. Cracked versions often lack access to official updates, multiplayer servers, and support. It's important to note that using cracked versions of the game violates Minecraft's terms of service and can result in legal consequences."]}],[{"l":"FAQ","p":["Got questions about Minecraft Clients? \uD83E\uDD14 Look no further!
