ALT | Alternative account | An "alt account" is a term used to refer to an alternate account that a player owns in addition to their main account. Alt accounts are typically used for various purposes such as testing, trolling, or bypassing bans. Players often create alt accounts to have a separate identity in the game or to engage in activities without affecting their main account's reputation or progress.
NFA | Non-Full Access | An account type that lacks full control or access to Minecraft features, often limited in functionality.
SFA | Semi-Full Access | An account type with some restrictions but more features than NFA, usually used for certain Minecraft services.
MFA | Mail Full Access | An account type that comes with the mail that was used to create the account, usually used for people who wants to keep the account.
TID | Transaction ID | It often refers to the unique identifier associated with a transaction involving the purchase or acquisition of Minecraft. For example, when you buy a Minecraft account or redeem a gift code, you may receive a Transaction ID as proof of purchase.
OF Cape | OptiFine Cape | OptiFine is a popular Minecraft optimization mod that enhances the game's graphics and performance. Users who donate to OptiFine or make a contribution are sometimes rewarded with an OptiFine Cape. This cape is a cosmetic item that can be displayed on the player's character in-game, providing a unique and distinctive look.
UFA | Unmigrated Full Access | An account type that is no longer obtainable through the official Minecraft website. UFA accounts are valuable because they allow the owner to migrate the account to their own email address, providing full control over the account and its security.

Java Edition | Minecraft Java Edition is the original and most well-known version of Minecraft, developed in Java programming language. It is available for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms. Java Edition is favored by many players for its extensive modding support, larger multiplayer servers, and frequent updates. Players can enjoy a wide range of customizations and community-created content.
Bedrock Edition | Minecraft Bedrock Edition, often referred to as just "Minecraft," is the cross-platform version of the game available on various devices, including Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, mobile devices, and more. It features cross-play support, allowing players on different platforms to play together. Bedrock Edition offers a consistent experience and frequent updates across all supported platforms.
Modded Minecraft | Modded Minecraft refers to any version of Minecraft (usually Java Edition) that has been modified with player-created modifications or "mods." These mods can add new gameplay features, change existing mechanics, introduce new content, or enhance graphics. Modded Minecraft offers endless possibilities for customization and allows players to create unique and personalized experiences.
Cracked Minecraft | Cracked Minecraft is an unofficial version of the game where players can use pirated copies to play without purchasing the official game license. This practice is illegal and discouraged by both Mojang (the developer of Minecraft) and the Minecraft community. Cracked versions often lack access to official updates, multiplayer servers, and support. It's important to note that using cracked versions of the game violates Minecraft's terms of service and can result in legal consequences.
